	<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> 

		Hi, I’m Martha. I grew up in sunny Bournemouth and have lived in Kent, Spain and Germany since I finished school in 2010. I moved to London in October after two years of living in the wonderful city of Berlin and still work for a German media company as a QA & support engineer. Since graduating from a literature and linguistics degree, I’ve been searching for a career path that makes sense for me. After trying multiple options, software development is something that has stuck - it allows me to use my logical and analytical side, as well as nurture the creative one. I first came across coding several years ago when a friend recommended I give it a go. I dabbled with Codecademy but didn’t consider it to be a realistic possibility. Over the last few years it has kept coming back to me and is now something that I want to pursue seriously. When I’m not learning to code, I like to read, play the guitar & drums, go to gigs, and explore London.

	<h2 id="why"> Why F&C? </h2>
<p>
		When I came across Founders and Coders, I was immediately drawn to its ethos and collaborative way of learning. When I think about the work I find satisfying, it is either mentally challenging, or doing something good for the world. Founders and Coders puts emphasis on both, and what I love about software development, are the endless learning possibilities and the opportunity to work in many different types of companies and industries. I’m passionate about diversity and equal opportunities, so it makes me happy to see an organisation trying to do its bit within the tech sector. Finally, from what I’ve seen from the Meetups and short course, Founders and Coders fosters a really team-focused, supportive learning environment which I can see myself taking a lot from.
